"""
Suppose we have a q-binary string q1q2...q_n and we arrive
at a 1, while traversing the string in reverse order.
    <some string> 1 <some string with a zeros and b question marks>
Foreach zero to its right, there is an inversion for every binary
string generated (each for one question mark) so the inversions here
are a * 2**b. For the question mark, there are (b choose i) with i
zeros and for each of them we have i inversions, a total of
sum((b choose i) * i, i in {1,2,...,n}) = b * 2**(b-1) (exception
being when there are no question marks, then this value is 0).
Now this single 1 has counted for a*2**b + b*2**(b-1) inversion
for all strings generated but for any question marks to its left,
we have to count all these again which is what we do if we arrive
at a question mark. We first multiply the current total with 2
since the new question mark produces two new strings for every
existing string counted, all with those old inversions. Then we
treat the question mark as a one and repeat the process we already
did. Along the traversing way, we count the 0 to produce those
values and at each step, apply the modulus to prevent the total
becoming to large.
